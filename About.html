        <div>
        <p>Hey my name is Isaiah and I would like to go ahead with why I made these videos, it’s because I wanted to create wonder,the feeling of making the impossible, possible. When I make these videos,I wanted to evoke wonder through special effects, but I’ve come to love making animation in my videos as well. Because when I was a child, I would play pretend to be a ninja like the TMNT or a superhero like the power rangers because I would be in awe by the feats they would perform and the challenges they have overcome. I would always try to be on time on late Friday or early Saturday to watch my favorite cartoons because back in 2000-2010s you would have a good story.  Whether you can relate to the hero and want them to win or the villain to win, or the antihero to win,there are shows like Generator Rex, or The Owl house they show flawed yet relatable characters and compelling story development and I can assure you that is what I am going to do with my videos.
